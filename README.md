InDesign 2024 Enhansed Running Headers 

I'd like to experiment with writing a UXP script that puts paragraph numbers in running headings.
There is a first working version of the script that is built on Windows 10, and it would be nice if someone tried to run it on macOS.

The script needs to be placed in the UXPScript folder, it is immediately ready to work.
A test document is also attached.

The script does not currently declare any specific rules. The names of paragraph styles and text variables can be anything you like.

The script so far works with text variables based on Paragraph Styles. There was no need to use Character Styles yet.
